    The purpose of the limited_net profile is to provide a set of
    active services that allow one to connect to the machine via ssh
    (requires sshd). The services which are deactivated here are those
    that are at odds with this goal. Those which are activated are
    explicit requirements for the goal's satisfaction.

    NOTE:  Service profiles delivered by this package are not editable,
    and their contents will be overwritten by package or patch
    operations, including operating system upgrade.  Make customizations
    in a distinct file.  The paths, /etc/svc/profile/site.xml and
    /var/svc/profile/site.xml, are distinguished locations for site-specific
    service profile, treated otherwise equivalently to this file.
